  // of react. JSX is a syntax extension to javascript that allows us to
  // write HTML-like code inside javascript.
  //
  // note: the return statement can only return one element, so we wrap
  // everything in a div
  //
  // note: you can use javascript expressions inside JSX by wrapping them
  // in curly braces. this is how we can use the state variables in our JSX
  //
  // note: the className attribute is used instead of class
  // this is because class is a reserved keyword in javascript
  //
  // note: we pass the event handlers as props to the PeopleList and PeopleForm
  // components so that they can be used there. the ability to define your own
  // components and pass arbitrary props to them is another powerful feature
  // of react
